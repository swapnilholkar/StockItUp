"And what ""loopholes"" are we talking about, here?  Again, thinking people will want specifics...along with objective evidence and a rational argument. 

We get that this is all bullshit to feed your ignorant, misfit base and most of those who watch @foxnews."

I live surrounded by poverty in a big city filled with wealth. There are so many volunteers and shelters. A hand-out isn’t helping them. They need healthcare & a path forward. Not leftover chicken wings.
Nah! They are too dumb to think that deep.
"@FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Does anyone think imagrants know that boarding the good ship USA, & stand on USA soil, is when the Dems forget them. As they have done thier part in overthrowing the USA 4 now. R no use to Dems again till voting in 2020.Then will receive further orders."
When in doubt pull the race card.  Unfortunately the left has overplayed it. And I’m sure to the detriment of someone who is actually experiencing racism.
Not all were masons but many were. as to their  intent i could not tell you other then the founding documents. There are 13 families of the illuminati and they have wared against one another thru the ages.  Just like modern day mafia families joined together in illicet activity

So any answers to my questions?  Have you read the Mueller report?  What is your proof that Schiff lied and leaked?  Is your “military news” super supportive of the draft dodger in chief? Do all your views come from @FoxNews & DJT tweets? Am I a bot?
We all had to pay our college debt. Maybe they should take classes that lead to real jobs..

Thanks for the info.
"None of you were this outraged when Twitter was removing tweets from conservatives supporting Trump. If you would have been, maybe this wouldn't be happening now."
What is @FoxNews @seanhannity @senatemajldr so afraid of that is contained in the actual report?
"Everyone @FoxNews and other networks worried about the cost to US to close the border..., what does it cost us to pay their way in the US??? Be real!"
"I like the rotation of Bila, Boothe, Ortagus and Compagno."
"Another liberal Democrat advocating for ""free"" college.  I worked 3 jobs during college then lots of overtime to repay my loans.  How about encouraging a work ethic instead of a handout?!"

"Heck i still wanna ask the SEC why they didn't object when a court ruled that @FoxNews could fire a ""news"" announcer, who refused to lie on air, during market hours, fake news story that had 2do w/ pumping Monsanto's stock.
Where was the SEC ?

That was great interview. Good people you are!
Tonight at ten three conspiracy theorists try to out bullshite each other on fox.
@PPFA why no program for funding for help with raising a child. Seems you're more willing to help kill babies than help with keeping them from aborting healthy babies that someone would care for. Help The Mother Keep the Child Programs. @Foxnews #CNN
Have I lied about anything? No! I sat back and waited to see what happened and you booted me. So who’s the divider? People will see what they want to see.
"Greatest Political Scandal of Our Time.
How consider Obama Admin, HRC, Deep State slime?
Attempt to orchestrate silent coup of sitting president.
Cover ups by Obama, Clinton, DNC
How analyze MSM false or true?

The Europeans see only their own self interest. France has made significant investment in Iran’s energy sector. And who got the most out of the Iran deal? Russia. That deal also allowed them to move forces into Syria during Obama Admin with a strengthened IRG and Hezbollah
Another Free Shit  . Why are all Dems wanting to take from one & give to another......Let’s abolish Trumps tax cuts so student loans can be cleared. Hear is an idea. Instead of going to an overrated college why not a Vocational School.
